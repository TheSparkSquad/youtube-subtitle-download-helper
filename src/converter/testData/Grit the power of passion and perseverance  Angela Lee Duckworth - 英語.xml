Reviewer: Morton Bast</text><text start="12.88" dur="2.05">When I was 27 years old,</text><text start="14.954" dur="3.323">I left a very demanding job
in management consulting</text><text start="18.301" dur="3.757">for a job that was even more
demanding: teaching.</text><text start="23.298" dur="2.48">I went to teach seventh graders math</text><text start="25.802" dur="1.9">in the New York City public schools.</text><text start="28.202" dur="2.881">And like any teacher,
I made quizzes and tests.</text><text start="31.107" dur="1.976">I gave out homework assignments.</text><text start="33.107" dur="2.722">When the work came back,
I calculated grades.</text><text start="36.758" dur="4.552">What struck me was that IQ
was not the only difference</text><text start="41.334" dur="3.136">between my best and my worst students.</text><text start="45.017" dur="4.767">Some of my strongest performers
did not have stratospheric IQ scores.</text><text start="50.345" dur="3.238">Some of my smartest kids
weren&amp;#39;t doing so well.</text><text start="54.297" dur="1.397">And that got me thinking.</text><text start="56.432" dur="2.96">The kinds of things you need
to learn in seventh grade math,</text><text start="59.416" dur="4.902">sure, they&amp;#39;re hard: ratios, decimals,
the area of a parallelogram.</text><text start="64.668" dur="2.676">But these concepts are not impossible,</text><text start="67.368" dur="4.11">and I was firmly convinced
that every one of my students</text><text start="71.502" dur="2.58">could learn the material</text><text start="74.106" dur="2.063">if they worked hard and long enough.</text><text start="76.842" dur="2.462">After several more years of teaching,</text><text start="79.328" dur="3.734">I came to the conclusion
that what we need in education</text><text start="83.086" dur="3.46">is a much better understanding
of students and learning</text><text start="86.57" dur="2.317">from a motivational perspective,</text><text start="88.911" dur="2.206">from a psychological perspective.</text><text start="91.815" dur="5.493">In education, the one thing
we know how to measure best is IQ.</text><text start="98.172" dur="3.852">But what if doing
well in school and in life</text><text start="102.048" dur="2.094">depends on much more</text><text start="104.166" dur="3.38">than your ability to learn
quickly and easily?</text><text start="108.371" dur="1.926">So I left the classroom,</text><text start="110.321" dur="2.991">and I went to graduate school
to become a psychologist.</text><text start="113.877" dur="2.15">I started studying kids and adults</text><text start="116.051" dur="2.833">in all kinds of super
challenging settings,</text><text start="118.908" dur="2.428">and in every study my question was,</text><text start="121.36" dur="2.246">who is successful here and why?</text><text start="124.384" dur="3.593">My research team and I went
to West Point Military Academy.</text><text start="128.476" dur="1.66">We tried to predict which cadets</text><text start="130.16" dur="3.508">would stay in military training
and which would drop out.</text><text start="134.414" dur="2.231">We went to the National Spelling Bee</text><text start="136.669" dur="4.539">and tried to predict which children
would advance farthest in competition.</text><text start="141.867" dur="4.056">We studied rookie teachers
working in really tough neighborhoods,</text><text start="145.947" dur="3.417">asking which teachers are still
going to be here in teaching</text><text start="149.388" dur="1.994">by the end of the school year,</text><text start="151.406" dur="3.011">and of those, who will be
the most effective</text><text start="154.441" dur="2.684">at improving learning
outcomes for their students?</text><text start="157.592" dur="2.23">We partnered with private
companies, asking,</text><text start="159.846" dur="2.695">which of these salespeople
is going to keep their jobs?</text><text start="162.565" dur="1.866">And who&amp;#39;s going to earn the most money?</text><text start="164.797" dur="2.658">In all those very different contexts,</text><text start="167.479" dur="4.501">one characteristic emerged
as a significant predictor of success.</text><text start="172.464" dur="1.778">And it wasn&amp;#39;t social intelligence.</text><text start="174.662" dur="2.985">It wasn&amp;#39;t good looks, physical health,</text><text start="177.671" dur="1.318">and it wasn&amp;#39;t IQ.</text><text start="179.758" dur="1.116">It was grit.</text><text start="181.899" dur="4.63">Grit is passion and perseverance
for very long-term goals.</text><text start="186.989" dur="1.671">Grit is having stamina.</text><text start="189.232" dur="4.206">Grit is sticking with your future,
day in, day out,</text><text start="193.462" dur="3.365">not just for the week,
not just for the month,</text><text start="196.851" dur="1.532">but for years,</text><text start="198.407" dur="3.721">and working really hard
to make that future a reality.</text><text start="202.969" dur="4.269">Grit is living life
like it&amp;#39;s a marathon, not a sprint.</text><text start="208.156" dur="1.431">A few years ago,</text><text start="209.611" dur="3.014">I started studying grit
in the Chicago public schools.</text><text start="213.141" dur="2.288">I asked thousands of high school juniors</text><text start="215.453" dur="1.828">to take grit questionnaires,</text><text start="217.305" dur="1.952">and then waited around more than a year</text><text start="219.281" dur="1.356">to see who would graduate.</text><text start="221.518" dur="2.222">Turns out that grittier kids</text><text start="223.764" dur="3.18">were significantly more
likely to graduate,</text><text start="226.968" dur="3.762">even when I matched them
on every characteristic I could measure,</text><text start="230.754" dur="2.25">things like family income,</text><text start="233.028" dur="2.722">standardized achievement test scores,</text><text start="235.774" dur="3.024">even how safe kids felt
when they were at school.</text><text start="239.377" dur="2.937">So it&amp;#39;s not just at West Point
or the National Spelling Bee</text><text start="242.338" dur="1.114">that grit matters.</text><text start="243.476" dur="1.941">It&amp;#39;s also in school,</text><text start="245.441" dur="2.381">especially for kids
at risk for dropping out.</text><text start="249.116" dur="2.958">To me, the most shocking thing about grit</text><text start="252.098" dur="1.959">is how little we know,</text><text start="254.081" dur="2.502">how little science knows,
about building it.</text><text start="257.003" dur="2.251">Every day, parents and teachers ask me,</text><text start="259.278" dur="2.2">&amp;quot;How do I build grit in kids?</text><text start="261.502" dur="2.917">What do I do to teach kids
a solid work ethic?</text><text start="264.753" dur="2.488">How do I keep them motivated
for the long run?&amp;quot;</text><text start="267.86" dur="1.975">The honest answer is,</text><text start="269.859" dur="1.077">I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="270.96" dur="1.475">(Laughter)</text><text start="272.459" dur="3.039">What I do know is that talent
doesn&amp;#39;t make you gritty.</text><text start="275.522" dur="2.331">Our data show very clearly</text><text start="277.877" dur="2.413">that there are many talented individuals</text><text start="280.314" dur="3.119">who simply do not follow through
on their commitments.</text><text start="283.814" dur="4.214">In fact, in our data,
grit is usually unrelated</text><text start="288.052" dur="3.121">or even inversely related
to measures of talent.</text><text start="292.465" dur="4.095">So far, the best idea I&amp;#39;ve heard
about building grit in kids</text><text start="296.584" dur="2.222">is something called &amp;quot;growth mindset.&amp;quot;</text><text start="299.449" dur="3.67">This is an idea developed
at Stanford University by Carol Dweck,</text><text start="303.143" dur="5.098">and it is the belief that the ability
to learn is not fixed,</text><text start="308.265" dur="2.467">that it can change with your effort.</text><text start="311.44" dur="1.319">Dr. Dweck has shown</text><text start="312.783" dur="3.135">that when kids read
and learn about the brain</text><text start="315.942" dur="3.474">and how it changes and grows
in response to challenge,</text><text start="319.44" dur="3.997">they&amp;#39;re much more likely
to persevere when they fail,</text><text start="323.461" dur="4.609">because they don&amp;#39;t believe that failure
is a permanent condition.</text><text start="329.052" dur="3.13">So growth mindset
is a great idea for building grit.</text><text start="332.724" dur="1.537">But we need more.</text><text start="334.825" dur="2.096">And that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m going
to end my remarks,</text><text start="336.945" dur="1.346">because that&amp;#39;s where we are.</text><text start="338.315" dur="2.165">That&amp;#39;s the work that stands before us.</text><text start="340.504" dur="3.88">We need to take our best ideas,
our strongest intuitions,</text><text start="344.408" dur="1.635">and we need to test them.</text><text start="346.512" dur="2.711">We need to measure
whether we&amp;#39;ve been successful,</text><text start="349.247" dur="3.706">and we have to be willing
to fail, to be wrong,</text><text start="352.977" dur="2.638">to start over again with lessons learned.</text><text start="356.336" dur="2.944">In other words, we need to be gritty</text><text start="359.304" dur="2.469">about getting our kids grittier.</text><text start="362.177" dur="1.032">Thank you.</text><text start="363.233" dur="2.835">(Applause)</text></transcript>
