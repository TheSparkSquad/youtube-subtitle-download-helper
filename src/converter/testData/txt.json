  {
    "text": "To me, the most shocking thing about grit"

    "text": "What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty."

  {
    "text": "Our data show very clearly"

    "text": "who simply do not follow through on their commitments."

    "text": "In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated"

  },
  {
    "text": "So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids"
  },

    "text": "is something called \"growth mindset.\""
  },
  {
    "text": "This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck,"

    "text": "that it can change with your effort."
  },
  {
    "text": "Dr. Dweck has shown"
  },
  {
    "text": "that when kids read and learn about the brain"
  },
  {
    "text": "and how it changes and grows in response to challenge,"
  },
  {
    "text": "they're much more likely to persevere when they fail,"
  },
  {
    "text": "because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition."
  },
  {
    "text": "So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit."
  },
  {
    "text": "But we need more."
  },
  {
    "text": "And that's where I'm going to end my remarks,"

  {
    "text": "because that's where we are."
  },
  {
    "text": "That's the work that stands before us."
  },
  {
    "text": "We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions,"
  },
  {
    "text": "and we need to test them."
  },
  {
    "text": "We need to measure whether we've been successful,"
  },
  {
    "text": "and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong,"
  },
  {
    "text": "to start over again with lessons learned."
  },
  {
    "text": "In other words, we need to be gritty"
